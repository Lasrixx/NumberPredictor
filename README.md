# NumberPredictor
Function that takes in a sequence of integers and underscores (where underscores represent a missing digit) and predicts what digits will replace the underscores to preserve the patterns in the string.



The idea is to look back through the string to find previous patterns that have occured and test if these rules can apply to the current underscore.
